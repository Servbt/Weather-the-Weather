// this challenge seems to be divided into four main chunks //
    // i technically have to style the page too...

// I need to successfully access the weather api and fectch the appropriate data //
    // I'm probably going to need json
    // once I get that I can pass that info (arguements) into other functions to use
        // I have to fetch location data
        // I also have to fetch weather data based on location...

    // if I cant fetch I should probably try and display a message of some kind 

//a submission portion that finds the city your looking for //
    // needs to include a submission form
        

    // I also need a button to trigger submission form 
        //need to make a function to search the data and find that once the button is clicked

    //once that happens I need it to display the chosen city as a button underneath
        // once the data is found  I need to make the proper elements 
            //once the elements are made I need to set their respective text contents
            // after that I have to also assign their proper tags for styling
            // and finally I can append them on the page
            

//a status container that displays the current forecast of a city at the forefront //
    //needs to add a header with a respective title 

    //need to append the four proper pieces of info with the data that was parsed
        // these are temperature, wind speed, humidity levels, and Ultraviolet index
            //for UV index i need a way to style it if the number reacches a certain threshold



//and finally a five day forecast that consists of cards that have some basic info attached to them //
    //similar to the previous card
        // this time it seems to be looping through 5 independent pieces of iterations
        //  I SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE RENDERING ALL OF THE DATA ONE FUNCTION (thanks to seths pseudo code)

    // i'm gonna have a hard time with this..
        //once I find a loop and get the appropriate data through each iteration I have to display that info in 5 cute little divs
