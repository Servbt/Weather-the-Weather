#Weather-the-Weather

This is still a work in progress, but I think at this point it'd be best to post what I have for now. The functionality for local storage and calling the API is present, as well as appending information on the page, it is severely in need of some more clean up though.. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading this.
